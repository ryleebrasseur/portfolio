# Test Failures Analysis & Todo Lists

## Problems Encountered & Lessons Learned

### 1. ❌ Missing Elements Warning
**Problem**: "Missing required elements: {heroName: false, heroTitle: false, heroEmail: false}"
**Root Cause**: Orchestrator runs before React components mount and register elements
**Solution Applied**: Changed from console.warn to console.log, accepted as normal first render

**TODO**:
- [ ] Add initialization state logging to MotionProvider
- [ ] Log element registration order with timestamps
- [ ] Add test to verify registration sequence
- [ ] Consider adding "ready" state to motion system

### 2. ❌ Duplicate Header Bug
**Problem**: Multiple headers created in DOM
**Root Cause**: React StrictMode double-render + no idempotent checks
**Solution Applied**: Added cleanup check for existing header

**TODO**:
- [ ] Add duplicate prevention logging in orchestrator
- [ ] Log React render cycles in development
- [ ] Add test specifically for duplicate prevention
- [ ] Add DOM mutation observer in tests to catch duplicates

### 3. ❌ Scroll Position Not Resetting on Refresh
**Problem**: Page stayed at 720px after refresh instead of 0
**Root Cause**: Browser scroll restoration happening AFTER our code
**Solution Applied**: 100ms delay before Observer + force scroll reset

**TODO**:
- [ ] Log all scroll events with timestamps
- [ ] Add test for various scroll restoration scenarios
- [ ] Log when browser restoration kicks in
- [ ] Consider increasing delay or using different approach

### 4. ❌ Kinetic Animation Not Working
**Problem**: Phone "animation" was just text changes, no actual flip
**Root Cause**: Incomplete implementation, missing flip containers
**Solution Applied**: Created proper flip structure with GSAP animations

**TODO**:
- [ ] Add animation state logging (start, progress, complete)
- [ ] Log each flip event with character changes
- [ ] Add visual regression test for animation
- [ ] Add performance logging for animations

### 5. ❌ Tests Passing When They Should Fail
**Problem**: Test checked for text changes but not animation structure
**Root Cause**: Poor assertions, not testing what actually matters
**Solution Applied**: Rewrote test to check for flipContainer/flipper elements

**TODO**:
- [ ] Add assertion logging (what we're checking and why)
- [ ] Log DOM structure before assertions
- [ ] Create assertion helpers with built-in logging
- [ ] Add "smoke test" that intentionally fails to verify assertions work

### 6. ❌ LogCollector CommonJS Error
**Problem**: "require is not defined" in ESM environment
**Root Cause**: Used require() instead of dynamic import()
**Solution Applied**: Changed to import('fs/promises')

**TODO**:
- [ ] Add ESM/CJS environment detection logging
- [ ] Log module system being used
- [ ] Add test for LogCollector functionality
- [ ] Consider using Playwright's built-in fs utilities

### 7. ❌ CSS Module Class Names
**Problem**: Tests using '.scrollTextDesktop' failed - class was hashed
**Root Cause**: CSS modules generate unique class names
**Solution Applied**: Used attribute selectors and child element queries

**TODO**:
- [ ] Log generated class names in development
- [ ] Create CSS module test helpers
- [ ] Add data-testid attributes for critical elements
- [ ] Log CSS module mappings during tests

### 8. ❌ Observer Blocking All Scrolls
**Problem**: preventDefault: true blocked even programmatic scrolls
**Root Cause**: Observer too aggressive with scroll prevention
**Solution Applied**: Delayed Observer creation, force scroll before

**TODO**:
- [ ] Log all prevented scroll events
- [ ] Add Observer state logging (active/inactive)
- [ ] Test programmatic vs user scrolls
- [ ] Consider Observer pause/resume functionality

### 9. ❌ React Double Initialization
**Problem**: Everything initializing twice
**Root Cause**: StrictMode in development (actually not - still happening)
**Solution Applied**: Made operations idempotent

**TODO**:
- [ ] Log React lifecycle events
- [ ] Add render count tracking
- [ ] Test in production build
- [ ] Add initialization guard with logging

### 10. ❌ Memory Leaks
**Problem**: Observer not being cleaned up
**Root Cause**: No cleanup in useEffect return
**Solution Applied**: Added observer.kill() in cleanup

**TODO**:
- [ ] Log all cleanup operations
- [ ] Add memory usage logging
- [ ] Test cleanup actually works
- [ ] Add leak detection in tests

### 11. ❌ Lenis Smooth Scrolling Conflicts
**Problem**: Lenis conflicting with Observer pattern
**Root Cause**: Two systems trying to control scroll
**Solution Applied**: Disabled Lenis with early return

**TODO**:
- [ ] Log when Lenis would initialize
- [ ] Add conflict detection logging
- [ ] Test with Lenis fully removed
- [ ] Document why Lenis is disabled

### 12. ❌ Session Storage Persistence
**Problem**: MotionProvider restoring scroll position
**Root Cause**: Scroll persistence feature conflicting with our needs
**Solution Applied**: Disabled with early return

**TODO**:
- [ ] Log all session storage operations
- [ ] Add test for storage conflicts
- [ ] Consider namespacing storage keys
- [ ] Add storage state viewer in tests

## Coverage & Automation Tools

### 1. Istanbul/nyc for Code Coverage
```bash
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test @vitest/coverage-istanbul
```

### 2. Playwright's Built-in Coverage
```typescript
// In playwright.config.ts
use: {
  // Collect coverage
  coverage: {
    enabled: true,
    include: ['src/**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
    exclude: ['**/*.test.{ts,tsx}']
  }
}
```

### 3. Automatic Logging Injection
Consider creating a Vite plugin to automatically add logging:
```typescript
// vite-plugin-auto-log.ts
export function autoLog() {
  return {
    name: 'auto-log',
    transform(code, id) {
      if (id.includes('orchestrator')) {
        // Inject console.log at function starts
        return injectLogs(code)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Playwright Trace Viewer
Already available - captures everything:
```bash
npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

## Master TODO List
