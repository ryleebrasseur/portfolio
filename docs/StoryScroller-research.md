# A Paranoid Engineer's Field Manual: Production-Ready React + GSAP Scroll-Snapping System

## First 10 Things to Check If Scroll Breaks in Production

1.  **Check `isAnimating` flag:** Is the scroll system currently in an animation state preventing new inputs?
2.  **Review Lenis & GSAP Ticker Synchronization:** Are Lenis and GSAP fighting for control? Ensure GSAP's ticker drives Lenis.
3.  **Verify `useGSAP` Hook Usage:** Are all GSAP instances and non-GSAP objects properly cleaned up on component unmount, especially in React 18 Strict Mode?
4.  **Inspect Hydration Warnings (Next.js):** Are there any "Extra attributes from the server: style" warnings indicating ScrollTrigger modifying the `body` too early?
5.  **Test on Physical Mac Trackpad:** Is the "double-fire" issue manifesting due to momentum scrolling? Check `tolerance` and debouncing logic.
6.  **Assess Memory Leaks:** Is memory usage continually growing? Look for unkilled event listeners in GSAP callbacks or lingering `pin-spacer` elements.
7.  **Confirm `getBoundingClientRect` for Position:** Is `offsetTop` being used instead of `getBoundingClientRect` for target element positions?
8.  **Validate `preventDefault: true`:** Is the browser's native scroll behavior being properly stopped without breaking accessibility?
9.  **Check Dependency Versions:** Has a new version of `lenis` or GSAP introduced breaking changes, especially the `@studio-freight/lenis` to `lenis` migration?
10. **Examine Browser Extension Conflicts:** Are browser extensions (e.g., Grammarly, ColorZilla) interfering with DOM calculations or event handling?

## Consensus vs. Controversy Table

| Major Decision/Workaround/Pattern | Consensus Sources | Divergence/Controversy & Rationale |
| :------------------------------- | :---------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| **Mac Trackpad "Double-Fire" Issue** | | **No perfect solution exists.** The problem is hardware-based (momentum wheel events).<br> - **Workarounds:** `isAnimating` flag, increased `tolerance` on Observer, `ScrollTrigger.addEventListener("scrollEnd",...)` for debouncing, `overflow: hidden` on body temporarily. |
| **React 18 Strict Mode Handling** | | **Universal agreement on `useGSAP` hook.** It's "mandatory for survival" and the "cornerstone of stability" due to automatic cleanup via `gsap.context()`. Manual cleanup for non-GSAP objects is still critical. |
| **GSAP Ticker & Lenis Synchronization** | | **Lenis must be subordinated to GSAP's ticker.** Running two `requestAnimationFrame` loops causes "jank and conflicting behavior". The "only robust solution" is driving `lenis.raf(time * 1000)` from `gsap.ticker.add()` and removing the callback on cleanup. |
| **Next.js Hydration Mismatches** | | **Critical Framework Conflict.** ScrollTrigger modifies `body` styles, causing hydration errors.<br> - **Workarounds:** Delaying ScrollTrigger init with `setTimeout`, or suppressing warnings with `suppressHydrationWarning` (not recommended, "admission of defeat"). |
| **Memory Leak Culprits** | | **Specific vectors identified.** Event listeners in GSAP callbacks (closures), storing GSAP instances in component state, ScrollTrigger with pinning (pin-spacer elements), `gsap.ticker.add()` callbacks not removed. The `useGSAP` context array growing is noted as memory pressure but not a true leak. |
| **`offsetTop` vs. `getBoundingClientRect`** | | **`getBoundingClientRect` is the only reliable method.** `offsetTop` "will lie" about an element's true position in modern layouts with CSS transforms. The formula is `element.getBoundingClientRect().top + window.scrollY`. |
| **CSS `scroll-snap-type` Fallback** | | **`y mandatory` is an accessibility trap.** It can prevent users from viewing overflowing content. `y proximity` is the "safer, production-ready choice". |
| **Testing Strategy for Animations** | | **Focus on outcomes, not pixel-perfect animation.** Test that application state or DOM is as expected *after* animation.<br> - **Methods:** Mock/short-circuit animation timing, simulate CSS events, prefer test hooks, use `prefers-reduced-motion` in E2E tests, validate cleanup. |
| **Discarded Alternatives** | | **Locomotive Scroll v5 & fullpage.js rejected.** <br> - **Locomotive v5:** Not production-ready, unstable, Next.js incompatibilities, SSR failures, architectural flaws (hardcoded scroll wrapper), widespread bugs.<br> - **fullpage.js:** GPLv3 license (commercial barrier), "integration fragility" with React (crashes, state conflicts, opaque abstraction). |
| **Centralized Animation Management** | | **Strong recommendation.** Use `@ryleebrasseur/motion-system` or similar to abstract raw GSAP calls, provide wrapper hooks, define motion components, and unify scroll/smooth scroll integration. This reduces errors and duplication. |
| **Folder Hierarchy & Component Design** | | **Strong recommendation.** Separate `components/`, `sections/`, `hooks/`, `motion/`, `context/`, `styles/` directories. Enforce PascalCase for components/files, `use` prefix for hooks, and single responsibility per file.. |
| **CSS Styling Consistency** | | **Strict adherence to one strategy.** Use CSS Modules uniformly (Sass/PostCSS). Enforce naming conventions (kebab-case), omit units for zeros, use `rem`/`em`, avoid global CSS leakage, and use CSS variables. |
| **Git Commit Hygiene** | | **Strong recommendation.** Adopt conventional commit format (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) with `commitlint` and `Husky` hooks. Ensure lint/test checks pass before PR merge. |

## Background & Problem Framing

The objective is to construct a section-snapping scroll system that is lean, performant, and, above all, **resilient**. This requires a composition of specialized, best-in-class tools rather than a monolithic framework. The selection process is adversarial, vetting each dependency against a history of documented failures, community complaints, and architectural weaknesses. The goal is not to find a perfect solution—as none exists—but to choose the combination with the most understood and manageable failure modes. This system, while robustly designed, is not infallible, and a paranoid engineer must remain vigilant to external threats and future changes.

The dream of a perfectly smooth, universally compatible, bug-free scroll-jacking system remains just that—a dream. These tools were largely conceived before the complexities of modern React and Next.js, and integrating them engages in a constant battle to bridge a fundamental architectural divide.

## Chosen Stack, Discouraged Alternatives (with Rationales)

### 1.1 The Core Components: A Paranoid Evaluation

The chosen stack consists of **Lenis** for smooth scrolling, **GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP)** for low-level control, and the **`@gsap/react` hook** to manage the volatile lifecycle of a modern React application. This combination is selected because it grants maximum control while exposing its primitives, allowing for a robust, custom-built system rather than relying on an opaque, high-level abstraction. However, each component introduces its own threat vector that must be understood and mitigated.

| **Lenis**               | Provides a lightweight (under 4kb), dependency-free smooth scroll engine that normalizes user inputs (trackpad, mouse wheel) and runs in the main thread to synchronize with animations, promising a "flawless" experience [52 (1)].                                                                   | Prone to conflicts when its internal animation loop (`requestAnimationFrame`) competes with GSAP's ticker [52 (3), 62]. In a React 18 environment, improper initialization within `useEffect` without meticulous cleanup leads to duplicate instances, jank, and memory leaks [52 (3), 62]. Can interfere with native scroll behavior on nested elements if not configured correctly [52 (6)]. The `@studio-freight/lenis` package was renamed to `lenis`, breaking thousands of projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | **Acceptable, but only with strict subordination.** Lenis **must not run its own animation loop**. Its `raf` method **must be manually driven by the `gsap.ticker`**. All initialization and destruction must be militantly managed within a React hook's cleanup function to survive React 18's Strict Mode. Nested scroll is handled via the `data-lenis-prevent` attribute [52 (64), 64]. To avoid SSR issues, Lenis should be dynamically imported. Configuration options like `smoothTouch: false` are critical to prevent mobile conflicts, and `autoResize: true` helps with Firefox. |
| **GSAP 3.13+**          | A suite of powerful, low-level plugins for comprehensive control over scroll and interaction events. `Observer` detects wheel, touch, and pointer events; `ScrollToPlugin` animates scroll position; and `ScrollTrigger` orchestrates scroll-based animations [52 (8)].                                    | `Observer` is notoriously susceptible to "double-firing" on devices with momentum scrolling, particularly Apple trackpads, which continue to emit "wheel" events after a user's flick is complete [27, 29, 30, 35, 52 (11), 62, 105, 116]. `ScrollToPlugin` can fail if the scroll target is not correctly identified (window vs. body) or if user scrolling interrupts the tween [52 (13)]. `ScrollTrigger` can miscalculate positions on mobile devices with insufficient scroll height or when its trigger elements are animated on the y-axis [35, 52 (15)]. `ScrollTrigger` modifies body style during initialization, calculating bounds that add inline styles, causing hydration mismatches in Next.js. Memory leaks can occur from `Tween` objects not being garbage collected, especially with `pin: true` creating "pin-spacer" elements. | **Essential, but requires defensive programming.** The power of these tools demands disciplined implementation. The trackpad issue is a hardware reality, requiring application-level logic like state flags (`isAnimating`), increased `tolerance` (e.g., 50 for trackpads), and `scrollEnd` event debouncing. `ScrollTo` targets **must be calculated with `getBoundingClientRect()`** (not `offsetTop`). All GSAP instances **must be rigorously cleaned up**. Hydration errors require delaying `ScrollTrigger` initialization. `preventDefault: true` is crucial for Observer but needs accessibility testing. Configure `ScrollTrigger.config({ syncInterval: 40 })` to reduce position drift. |
| **`@gsap/react` (`useGSAP` hook)** | A purpose-built React hook that serves as a drop-in replacement for `useEffect`/`useLayoutEffect`. It automatically manages the cleanup of all GSAP instances (tweens, timelines, ScrollTriggers) created within its scope using `gsap.context()`, solving critical issues related to React 18's Strict Mode double-invocations [34, 52 (10), 60, 61, 72, 98, 106].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | While it automates cleanup for animations created _during_ the hook's execution, it does not automatically handle animations created later in event handlers (e.g., `onClick`). These must be explicitly wrapped in a `contextSafe()` function to be included in the cleanup context, a nuance that can lead to memory leaks if overlooked [52 (10), 118]. The internal `context.data` array can grow with every new animation, which, while not a leak, is a memory consideration for highly interactive components [52 (18), 119].                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Mandatory. This is the cornerstone of stability.** Using GSAP in React 18 without this hook is an "invitation for non-deterministic bugs and memory leaks". The architecture **must be built around its lifecycle**. The return function of the hook is the designated kill zone for all non-GSAP objects like Lenis instances and Observer listeners. The risk of unbounded context growth is minimal for this specific implementation but noted as a potential threat. Use `contextSafe()` for event handlers that create animations [52 (10), 118]. |

### 1.2 The Discarded Alternatives: A Post-Mortem

A robust system is defined as much by what it excludes as by what it includes. Two popular alternatives, **Locomotive Scroll v5** and **fullpage.js**, were considered and decisively rejected based on evidence of instability, architectural flaws, and licensing constraints.

#### Locomotive Scroll v5: A Cautionary Tale of "Beta" Software

Locomotive Scroll v5 was a candidate due to its modern architecture, rebuilt on top of Lenis. However, an investigation reveals it is **not production-ready** for a mission-critical application. The term "beta" appears to be a euphemism for fundamental, unresolved issues.

Its GitHub issue tracker (2024 and beyond) paints a clear picture of instability:
*   **Next.js Instability:** Open issues describe layout "jumps and bottom cutoff" specifically in Next.js, indicating a core incompatibility [54 (19)].
*   **SSR Failures:** Multiple reports of `ReferenceError: window is not defined` suggest the library doesn't safely handle server-side rendering, a "critical failure" for Next.js [54 (19), 54 (20)].
*   **Architectural Flaws:** The `v5 _init()` method hardcodes the scroll wrapper to `window` and content to `document.documentElement`, overriding custom elements [54 (21)]. This makes applying smooth scrolling to a specific container "impossible" and is a "deal-breaker" for component-based design.
*   **Widespread Bugs:** The issue list is extensive, covering broken mobile layouts, incorrect height calculations, conflicts with other libraries, and TypeScript definition errors [54 (19)].

The sheer volume and severity of these open issues indicate that Locomotive Scroll v5 is **not a stable foundation** and represents an "unacceptable level of risk".

#### fullpage.js: The Wrapper is a Trap

On the surface, `@fullpage/react-fullpage` offers a turnkey solution [55 (23)]. This convenience is its primary allure but also its greatest weakness. High-level wrappers are often a trap, trading control and transparency for a brittle, opaque abstraction that becomes a nightmare to debug.

Evidence against using fullpage.js is twofold:
*   **Licensing:** The library is licensed under GPLv3, making it **legally unusable in most closed-source commercial projects** without purchasing a commercial license. This is a "significant barrier".
*   **Integration Fragility:** The official React wrapper's GitHub repository reveals a long history of persistent and complex integration problems. Recent issues (2023-2024) include crashes on page reload, inability to scroll outside the wrapper in Next.js, state management conflicts, and the `fullpage_api` not being available [56 (24)]. These are symptoms of a "leaky abstraction". Debugging `TypeError: 'previousElementSibling'` means debugging the wrapper's "arcane internal state," introducing "enormous, unpredictable dependency risk".

fullpage.js is the "antithesis" of the project's philosophy to build with understood, low-level primitives, and is therefore rejected.

## Full, Annotated Implementation Recipe

This section presents the implementation of the `StoryScroller` component. It is a running debug diary, where every line of code is cross-examined against documented failure modes and community-reported bugs.

### 2.1 Component Scaffolding and Dependency Registration

Plugin registration **must occur at the module level**, outside the component's render cycle.

```javascript
// StoryScroller.jsx — Paranoid, Adversarial Edition

// STEP 0: Import dependencies.
// Cross-reference with package exports, not just docs. As of GSAP 3.13+,
// 'gsap/all' is a reliable way to get the core plugins, but in a production
// build focused on bundle size, one would import from 'gsap/ScrollTrigger',
// 'gsap/ScrollToPlugin', etc., individually. For this implementation, 'gsap/all'
// is sufficient but noted as a potential optimization.
import React, { useRef, useState, useEffect, useCallback } from "react"; // Added from ParanoidScrollSystem
import gsap from "gsap";
import { ScrollTrigger, ScrollToPlugin, Observer } from "gsap/all";
import { useGSAP } from "@gsap/react";

// CRITICAL: Dynamic import for Lenis to avoid SSR issues.
// This ensures Lenis is never executed on the server.
const initLenis = async () => {
    const Lenis = (await import('lenis')).default;
    return Lenis;
};

// DANGER ZONE: PLUGIN REGISTRATION
// This MUST be done once at the module level, NOT inside the component.
// GSAP's registerPlugin is idempotent (safe to call multiple times), but placing it
// inside a React component is a sloppy practice that can cause unnecessary
// recalculations during hot-reloading in a Next.js development environment.
// It signals a misunderstanding of React's render lifecycle. Do it here, do it once.
gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger, ScrollToPlugin, Observer);
```

### 2.2 The `useGSAP` Hook: Taming React 18 Strict Mode

The entire logic of the component is encapsulated within the `useGSAP` hook. This is a strategic necessity due to React 18's Strict Mode, which intentionally mounts, unmounts, and remounts components in development to surface bugs related to improper side-effect cleanup. Any animation or event listener initialized in a standard `useEffect` without a flawless, corresponding cleanup function will be duplicated, leading to memory leaks, visual glitches, and conflicting tickers.

The `useGSAP` hook provides a `gsap.context()`, which automatically records all GSAP instances created within its scope and calls `.revert()` on them when the component unmounts. This is the primary defense. The implementation is architected entirely around this setup-and-teardown lifecycle. Every resource allocated **must be deallocated** in the hook's return function.

```javascript
// From ParanoidScrollSystem, detects actual mount vs StrictMode double mount
const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false);
const mountCountRef = useRef(0);
useEffect(() => {
    mountCountRef.current += 1;
    setIsClient(true);
}, []);

export const StoryScroller = ({ sections }) => {
    // container: A ref to the main scrolling element for scoping GSAP selectors.
    const container = useRef(null);
    // idx: A ref to hold the current section index. Using useRef avoids triggering
    // re-renders on change, which is desirable here since the index is only used
    // for internal animation logic, not for rendering UI. If the index needed to
    // drive a nav component or URL hash, this state would need to be lifted
    // into React state (useState) and likely a shared context.
    const idx = useRef(0);
    // isAnimating: A critical state flag to prevent event handler pile-up,
    // especially from momentum-scrolling devices.
    const isAnimating = useRef(false);
    const lastScrollTime = useRef(0); // From ParanoidScrollSystem for Mac trackpad

    // The entire operational logic is contained here. This hook is our bastion
    // against React 18's double-effect invocation.
    useGSAP(() => {
        if (!isClient) return; // Only run on client-side after actual mount

        const setupScroll = async () => { // Wrapped in async function to handle dynamic import
            try {
                const Lenis = await initLenis(); // Dynamically import Lenis

                // ========================================================================
                // 1. SMOOTH SCROLL: Lenis Initialization & GSAP Ticker Synchronization
                // ========================================================================
                // WHAT BREAKS HERE? If you instantiate Lenis but forget to destroy it on
                // cleanup, React's Strict Mode will create a second, "ghost" Lenis instance
                // on remount. You'll have two libraries fighting for control of the scroll,
                // causing extreme jank and memory leaks.
                const lenis = new Lenis({
                    lerp: 0.1, // Lower values create a "smoother," more delayed scroll.
                    duration: 1.2, // From ParanoidScrollSystem
                    easing: (t) => Math.min(1, 1.001 - Math.pow(2, -10 * t)), // From ParanoidScrollSystem
                    orientation: 'vertical', // From ParanoidScrollSystem
                    gestureOrientation: 'vertical', // From ParanoidScrollSystem

  a critical accessibility failure. [64 (33), 65, 120]

        isScrolling = false; // Reset when GSAP confirms scroll has truly ended
    });
    Observer.create({
        target: window,
        type: "wheel,touch",
        tolerance: 50, // Higher tolerance for trackpads
        preventDefault: true, // Crucial to prevent native scroll interference
        onDown: () => {
            if (!isScrolling) {
                isScrolling = true;
                // Trigger your animation/goto logic here
            }
        }
    });
    // Alternative: Use an interval to check for scroll end
    const lastScrollTime = useRef(0);
    const checkScrollEnd = setInterval(() => {
        if (Date.now() - lastScrollTime.current > 150) { // If no scroll events for 150ms
            isScrolling.current = false;
        }
    }, 100);
    // Remember to clearInterval(checkScrollEnd) in cleanup!
    ```

*   **Next.js Hydration Error Workaround (Delaying ScrollTrigger Init):**
    ```javascript
    useEffect(() => {
        if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
            setTimeout(() => {
                gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger); // Register plugins if not global
                // Configure ScrollTrigger.scrollerProxy, etc. here
                ScrollTrigger.config({ syncInterval: 40 }); // Reduces position drift
            }, 100); // Small delay to allow hydration to complete
        }
    }, []);
    ```

*   **Suppressing Hydration Warnings (Not Recommended):**
    ```javascript
    useEffect(() => {
        if (typeof document !== 'undefined') {
            const bodyStyle = document.body.getAttribute('style');
            if (bodyStyle && bodyStyle.includes('overflow')) {
                document.body.removeAttribute('style'); // Temporarily remove styles
                requestAnimationFrame(() => {
                    document.body.setAttribute('style', bodyStyle); // Restore after hydration
                });
            }
        }
    }, []);
    // For specific elements, you can add suppressHydrationWarning={true} as a prop (admission of defeat)
    ```

*   **Lenis & GSAP Ticker Synchronization:**
    ```javascript
    // Instantiate Lenis without its internal RAF loop (default when instantiated manually)
    const lenis = new Lenis({ /* config */ });

    // Let GSAP's ticker drive Lenis
    const tickerCallback = (time) => {
        lenis.raf(time * 1000); // Lenis needs milliseconds
    };
    gsap.ticker.add(tickerCallback);

    // CRITICAL: Cleanup
    // In your useGSAP return function:
    // gsap.ticker.remove(tickerCallback);
    // lenis.destroy();
    ```

*   **Memory Leak Prevention (Event Listeners in GSAP Callbacks):**
    ```javascript
    useGSAP(() => {
        // Get contextSafe function for safe event handlers
        const { contextSafe } = useGSAP();

        const handleResizeSafe = contextSafe(() => {
            // Your resize logic that uses GSAP or component state
        });

        gsap.to('.box', {
            onComplete: () => {
                window.addEventListener('resize', handleResizeSafe); // Use contextSafe wrapped function
            }
        });

        return () => {
            window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResizeSafe); // Manual cleanup
        };
    }, []);
    ```

*   **Correct Scroll Target Calculation (`getBoundingClientRect`):**
    ```javascript
    const targetElement = document.getElementById('my-section'); // Or from a ref
    if (targetElement) {
        // Correct formula: viewport-relative position + current scroll offset
        const y = targetElement.getBoundingClientRect().top + window.scrollY;
        gsap.to(window, {
            scrollTo: {
                y: y,
                autoKill: false, // Prevent user scroll from immediately canceling
            },
            duration: 1.2,
            ease: "power2.inOut",
        });
    }
    ```

*   **CSS Fallback (Safe Scroll-Snap):**
    ```css
    /* Use proximity, NOT mandatory */
    .scroll-container-fallback {
      scroll-snap-type: y proximity;
      height: 100vh;
      overflow-y: scroll;
    }
    .scroll-section-fallback {
      scroll-snap-align: start;
      height: 100vh;
    }
    ```

*   **E2E Testing with `prefers-reduced-motion` (Playwright):**
    ```javascript
    // In your Playwright test setup or test code:
    await page.emulateMedia({ reducedMotion: 'reduce' });

    // In your JavaScript (e.g., at app startup or in a hook):
    if (window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches) {
        gsap.globalTimeline.timeScale(100); // Speed up all GSAP animations
        // Or set all durations to 0
        // gsap.defaults({ duration: 0 });
    }
    // In your CSS:
    // @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
    //   * { transition-duration: 0ms !important; animation-duration: 0ms !important; }
    // }
    ```

## Production-Ready Checklist: A Litany of Hard-Earned Lessons

Deploying a system like this requires more than just correct code; it requires a defensive mindset. This checklist codifies the hard-earned lessons from community forums and bug reports into a set of non-negotiable best practices.

*   **Militant Cleanup is Non-Negotiable.** In React 18, effect cleanup is not an optional optimization; it is a core requirement for stability [65 (10), 65 (26), 72]. The `useGSAP` hook is the first line of defense, but it only cleans up GSAP instances. Every non-GSAP object with event listeners or timers (`new Lenis()`, `Observer.create()`) **must** be manually destroyed in the hook's return function. Failure to do so **will** cause memory leaks and non-deterministic bugs in development due to Strict Mode's double-invocation.
*   **Synchronize Tickers, Do Not Compete.** There must be only one `requestAnimationFrame` loop. The most robust pattern is to let GSAP's ticker drive Lenis by calling `lenis.raf(time * 1000)` inside a `gsap.ticker.add()` callback. This prevents the two libraries from fighting for control, which manifests as visual stuttering and jank. The `lenis.raf` call **must be removed** from the ticker during cleanup [65 (3)].
*   **Trust `getBoundingClientRect`, Not `offsetTop`.** The `offsetTop` property is a relic that does not account for modern CSS like `transform` [65 (30)]. It will lie about an element's true position in any non-trivial layout. The only reliable method to get an element's rendered position is `getBoundingClientRect()` [65 (31), 65 (32)]. To get a document-relative value suitable for GSAP's `scrollTo` plugin, the correct and only formula is `const y = element.getBoundingClientRect().top + window.scrollY;`.
*   **Isolate All Client-Side Code.** In Next.js, any component that interacts with the `window` or `document` object—which includes this entire system—**must be explicitly marked as a client component** with the `"use client"` directive at the top of the file [65 (10)]. Failure to do so will result in SSR errors, as these global objects do not exist in the Node.js server environment [65 (36), 120].
*   **Throttle and Debounce All User Input.** Hardware is hostile. Devices with momentum scrolling (e.g., Mac trackpads) will fire a barrage of events [65 (11)]. Your system must be robust enough to handle this. The `Observer`'s `tolerance` property is the first defense. A simple boolean `isAnimating` flag, as implemented above, is the second and most critical defense, creating a hard cooldown that prevents event pile-up.
*   **Centralize Active Section State for Real Applications.** The `useRef` for the active index is sufficient for this isolated component. In a production application, this state is rarely isolated. If a navigation UI, URL hash, or analytics events need to know the active section, this state **must be lifted out** of the component and managed in a shared React Context or a dedicated state management library (like Zustand or Redux) to serve as a single source of truth.
*   **Test on Real, Hostile Hardware.** Emulators and browser developer tools are insufficient. They do not accurately replicate the unique physics and event-firing characteristics of physical hardware. This system **must** be tested on:
    *   A physical MacBook with a trackpad (to test momentum scrolling).
    *   A physical iPhone running Safari (to test touch gestures and mobile browser quirks).
    *   A Windows machine with a high-refresh-rate gaming mouse (to test high-frequency wheel events).
    Community forums are littered with bug reports that only manifest on specific physical devices [35, 65 (15)].
*   **Use Safe CSS Fallbacks.** A JavaScript-free fallback is essential for graceful degradation and accessibility. However, `scroll-snap-type: y mandatory` is a trap. If section content ever exceeds the viewport height, it becomes impossible for the user to scroll to and view that content [64, 65 (33)]. The only safe, production-ready option is `scroll-snap-type: y proximity`.
*   **Performance Metrics & Mobile Performance is Bad.** Smooth scroll libraries introduce significant memory usage and can dramatically lower frame rates, especially on mobile Safari (e.g., +100MB memory, 15-30fps). Native scroll is 3-5x faster. This cost **must be acknowledged** and deemed acceptable for the project's goals. Recommendations for production apps include using native CSS scroll-snap for critical features, progressive enhancement (add smooth scroll only for desktop), limiting to simple animations, and having a fallback.
*   **Browser Extension Conflicts.** Common extensions like Grammarly, ColorZilla, LastPass, and AdBlock can break GSAP/React apps by modifying the DOM, injecting styles, or blocking CDNs. A "nuclear option" is to detect problematic extensions using DOM attributes (e.g., `data-gr-ext-installed`).

### Coding Standards Checklist

To enforce a production-grade code standard, incorporate the following:

*   **ESLint Configuration:** Extend a well-established style guide such as Airbnb’s React/JSX guide for consistent coding conventions [83 (9), 83 (26)]. Ensure rules like `react/jsx-pascal-case` (component naming), `react/no-multi-comp` (one component per file), `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks`, and `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` (proper hook usage) are enabled.
*   **Prettier Formatting:** Continue using Prettier with a standardized config. All code should auto-format on save or commit. The `lint-staged` setup should be correctly formatting relevant file types on commit, and a Husky pre-commit hook should enforce linting and formatting.
*   **TypeScript Strictness:** Enable `strict` mode in `tsconfig.json` (i.e., `strict: true` along with `noUnusedLocals`, `noImplicitAny`, etc.). All components and functions should have defined prop and return types. Leverage shared types packages (e.g., `@ryleebrasseur/shared-types`). Consider adding `@typescript-eslint` rules to enforce consistent type definitions.
*   **Component/Function Standards:** Adhere to consistent definitions for React components, preferring function declarations over arrow functions for useful names in dev tools [87 (14)]. Always declare a return type for functions. Use descriptive names and avoid single-letter or overly abbreviated names. JSX attributes should use double quotes, and inline styles should be avoided unless dynamic styling is truly needed. Ensure hooks do not have conditional calls (Rule of Hooks).
*   **CSS and Styling Standards:** Define standards for naming and structure, e.g., `kebab-case` for CSS class names in modules. Omit units for zero values, use `rem`/`em` for scalability, and organize CSS rules logically. Avoid `id` or element selectors in CSS module files. Encourage using CSS custom properties (variables) for common values.
*   **Git Commit Hygiene:** Adopt a conventional commit format (e.g., Angular Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`). A `commitlint` tool with a Husky `commit-msg` hook can reject non-matching commits. Require all lint and test checks to pass before a PR can be merged (CI is already doing this in GitHub Actions).

## Refactor Proposal

To achieve a cleaner, professional baseline, the RyleeBrasseur portfolio codebase requires a more rigorous structure and coding standards.

### 1. Reorganize Folder Hierarchy for Clarity

Introduce a more scalable `apps/rylee-brasseur/src` structure to separate concerns:
*   **`components/`** – Reusable presentational components (buttons, form elements, etc.) that are relatively stateless and free of direct GSAP logic. Each in its own file (`Button.tsx`) with optional style module (`Button.module.scss`).
*   **`sections/`** (or `features/` or `pages/`) – Higher-level components corresponding to portfolio sections (Hero, About, Projects). These can be page-like composites that likely contain animation timelines. Each section can manage its own sub-components and styles in a subfolder (`HeroSection/index.tsx`, `HeroSection/styles.module.scss`).
*   **`hooks/`** – All custom React hooks (`useSmoothScroll.ts`, `useGsapTimeline.ts`). Centralizing these encourages reuse and consistent patterns.
*   **`motion/`** – (Optional, if not handled via `motion-system` package) Dedicated area for animation configurations, including easing curves, duration constants, or pre-built GSAP timelines. Can export functions like `fadeIn(element)`.
*   **`context/`** – Global providers (for theme, viewport, motion context for reduced-motion toggling).
*   **`styles/`** – Global styles, variables, or resets.

This refactor will separate animation logic from pure UI, making it easier to maintain and test in isolation.

### 2. Centralize Animation Management

Leverage the `@ryleebrasseur/motion-system` workspace package (or create one) to hold reusable motion utilities. The goal is to avoid writing raw GSAP calls in every component.
*   Implement a GSAP setup module that registers plugins (e.g., `ScrollTrigger`) and configures global defaults (`gsap.defaults({ ease: "power2.out", duration: 0.5 })`) once at app startup.
*   Provide wrapper hooks like `useGSAP()` (using the official one) or re-export it for consistency. Example `useFadeIn` hook.
*   Define motion components like `<RevealOnScroll>` that wrap children and internally use `ScrollTrigger`.
*   Ensure scroll and smooth scroll integration is unified. Configure GSAP’s `ScrollTrigger` to work with Lenis via `ScrollTrigger.scrollerProxy()` so all scroll-driven animations listen to the smooth scrolling engine.

Centralizing these patterns reduces errors and duplication, making animations easier to adjust globally.

### 3. Separation of Concerns & File Naming

Adopt a strict separation of concerns for code in each file. Each React component file should ideally contain only UI rendering and light state, delegating animation specifics to the motion system or hooks. Name files for what they export (e.g., `ScrollGallery.tsx` exports `ScrollGallery` component in PascalCase). Avoid ambiguous or generic filenames.

### 4. Extend Styling Consistency

Continue with Sass and PostCSS (with CSS Modules) uniformly. Create naming conventions for CSS classes (e.g., `heroSection_title` inside `HeroSection.module.scss`). Ensure no global CSS leakage occurs; encapsulate or eliminate legacy global styles.

## Testing Strategy Brief (Motion-Resilient Testing)

Testing a motion-heavy React app presents unique challenges as animations can introduce flakiness in tests if not handled. A two-pronged strategy focusing on unit tests with React Testing Library (RTL) and end-to-end (E2E) tests with Playwright is proposed, with techniques to make both resilient to animations.

*   **Focus on Outcomes, Not Pixel-Perfect Animation Verification:** Unit tests should assert the *result* of an animation or interaction, rather than the animation’s intermediate state. Verify that application state or DOM is as expected *after* the animation (e.g., checking visibility of a list after a button click). This aligns with testing behavior over implementation, reducing brittle tests.
*   **Mock or Short-Circuit Animation Timing in Tests:** Globally force animations to finish immediately in the test environment. Detect the test environment (`process.env.NODE_ENV === "test"`) and set all GSAP tweens to zero duration or call `gsap.globalTimeline.pause()`. Mock `gsap.to` and other methods to instantly apply the final state or call `onComplete` immediately. Alternatively, use Jest’s fake timers or RTL’s `waitFor` to simulate time passage.
*   **Simulate CSS Animation Events if Needed:** If CSS keyframe animations or transitions trigger state changes, dispatch events manually (e.g., `fireEvent.animationEnd(element)`). Use this sparingly, only when component logic is tied to animation lifecycle events.
*   **Prefer Test Hooks Over Visual Inspection:** Design components to expose testable hooks for animation state (e.g., `isVisible` state toggled by `ScrollTrigger` or `Intersection Observer`). Test this state change rather than trying to evaluate a partially animated DOM.
*   **E2E (Playwright) Strategies:** For end-to-end tests, enable `prefers-reduced-motion` in the test browser to minimize animations. Playwright can emulate this media query. Implement a global CSS rule (`@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`) or conditionally set GSAP durations to 0. With reduced-motion mode on, tests won't need explicit waits for animations. Leverage Playwright’s built-in waits (e.g., `wait for an element to be visible`) instead of fixed timeouts.
*   **Mock Three.js and Heavy Dependencies in Unit Tests:** For components with Three.js, mock the canvas or fiber renderer in unit tests (e.g., wrap in a conditional that skips rendering in a test environment, or provide a dummy `<div>`).
*   **Validate Animation Cleanup:** Ensure that when components unmount, they cleanup listeners or tweens. With `useGSAP` or `gsap.context`, cleanup is automatic. Add tests to mount/unmount components and verify no GSAP tweens remain active (e.g., inspecting GSAP’s global timeline). Tests can enforce that components follow cleanup standards.

By implementing these strategies, tests will remain green and reliable, even as complex animations are added, prioritizing critical functionality over exact motion mechanics. Reduced-motion accommodations also improve accessibility.

## The Threat Model: A Compendium of Open Dangers

This system, while robustly designed, is not infallible. A paranoid engineer remains vigilant to external threats and future changes that could compromise its stability. The following is a living list of dangers to monitor.

*   **Dependency Drift.** The web ecosystem is in constant flux. Future major versions of GSAP (e.g., 4.0) or Lenis (e.g., 2.0) could introduce breaking API changes. The `useGSAP` hook's behavior might evolve. While pinning dependency versions provides short-term stability, it is accumulating technical debt. Constant vigilance on changelogs and community channels is required.
*   **Next.js and React Evolution.** React 18 introduced `useEffect` double-invocation that necessitated this cleanup-centric architecture [66 (26)]. Future React versions may introduce new lifecycle behaviors or hooks. The Next.js App Router is still maturing, and its complex server/client component interaction model remains a fertile ground for new and unexpected bugs when integrating with DOM-heavy client-side libraries.
*   **OS and Browser Updates.** Mac trackpad momentum scrolling is an OS-level feature [66 (11)]. A future update to macOS, iOS, or Windows could alter scroll physics, rendering `tolerance` and debouncing logic ineffective. New browser versions could introduce regressions in `getBoundingClientRect`, `requestAnimationFrame`, or event handling.
*   **Layout Fragility and Upstream DOM Changes.** The `goto` function's reliance on `getBoundingClientRect` is resilient to CSS transforms, but not invincible. It relies on a predictable DOM structure (sections being direct children of the container). If sections are wrapped in a new container with complex styling or transforms, it could introduce subtle bugs.
*   **The Accessibility Blind Spot.** Any form of scroll-jacking is inherently risky for accessibility. The use of `preventDefault: true` can interfere with assistive technologies in unforeseen ways. Continuous testing with screen readers (like VoiceOver and NVDA) and by keyboard-only users is an ongoing process.

## The Bitter Truth (Based on Research)

1.  **No Universal Device Solution**: The trackpad momentum issue has no perfect fix—even GSAP's creator suggests workarounds, not solutions.
2.  **Framework Conflicts Are Real**: Next.js and GSAP fundamentally disagree about DOM manipulation during SSR/hydration.
3.  **Memory Leaks Are Common**: Even experienced developers struggle with proper cleanup in complex animations.
4.  **Mobile Performance Is Bad**: Every smooth scroll library tanks mobile performance—native scroll is 3-5x faster.
5.  **The Tools Weren't Built for React 18+**: These libraries predate modern React patterns and it shows.

The bitter truth: the dream of a perfectly smooth, universally compatible, bug-free scroll-jacking system remains a dream. The mission is not to achieve perfection, but to build the **least broken** system possible, armed with the knowledge of exactly how and when it will fail.
