# StoryScroller: A Production-Ready React+GSAP Scroll-Snapping System

## Background & Context

The `StoryScroller` component provides a **resilient and performant section-snapping scroll system** for modern React and Next.js applications. Building such a system is challenging due to complex interactions between browser events, hardware eccentricities, and React's lifecycle. This system is designed to be lean, using a combination of specialized, best-in-class tools rather than a monolithic framework.

The objective is not to find a perfect solution—none exists—but to choose the combination with the most understood and manageable failure modes. This component is the result of extensive research into common production pitfalls, aiming to anticipate and mitigate known failure modes (e.g., Mac trackpad momentum, Next.js hydration errors, memory leaks).

## Architecture Overview

The `StoryScroller` component is built on a "paranoid" engineering philosophy, integrating the following core components:

- **Lenis**: A lightweight smooth scroll engine. It normalizes user inputs (trackpad, mouse wheel) and provides a "flawless" smooth experience.
- **GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP)**:
  - **Observer**: Detects wheel, touch, and pointer events for low-level scroll control.
  - **ScrollToPlugin**: Animates scroll position programmatically.
  - **ScrollTrigger**: Orchestrates scroll-based animations (used indirectly via `scrollerProxy` for Lenis synchronization).
- **@gsap/react (useGSAP hook)**: A purpose-built React hook that automatically manages the cleanup of all GSAP instances created within its scope using `gsap.context()`. This is **mandatory** for stability in React 18's Strict Mode, which performs double-invocations of effects in development.

The system ensures **single source of truth** for the animation loop by making GSAP's ticker drive Lenis, preventing conflicting `requestAnimationFrame` loops that cause jank.

## Consensus vs. Controversy Table

This table summarizes key engineering decisions and workarounds, highlighting where sources agree or offer different perspectives.

| Aspect | Consensus | Divergence/Controversy & Rationale Test your scrolling with a real physical device.

- Check for browser extensions conflicts.
- Verify your cleanup functions for GSAP and Lenis.
- Ensure Next.js client component directive `“use client”` is present.
- Check for proper synchronization between Lenis and ScrollTrigger.
- Look for `offsetTop` usage and replace with `getBoundingClientRect()`.
- Inspect memory usage for potential leaks.
- Review your `tolerance` values for GSAP Observer.
- Ensure `isAnimating` or similar state flags are correctly implemented for debouncing.
- Check if `preventDefault: true` is causing accessibility issues.

## Quickstart & Usage

To integrate the `StoryScroller` into your Next.js application:

1.  **Place the files:**
    Copy `types.d.ts`, `StoryScroller.tsx`, `README.md`, `DESIGN_NOTES.md` into a directory like `components/StoryScroller/`.
2.  **Add `styles.css`:**
    Ensure the CSS styles for the fallbacks (from `DESIGN_NOTES.md#css-fallbacks`) are available globally in your application, e.g., in `globals.css` or similar.
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm add react gsap lenis @gsap/react
    pnpm add -D @types/gsap @types/react
    ```
4.  **Import and use in a Client Component:**
    Your page or parent component **must** be a Client Component (`"use client";`) if it imports `StoryScroller.tsx`.

    ```tsx
    // app/page.tsx (or any other client component)
    'use client'

    import { StoryScroller } from '../components/StoryScroller/StoryScroller'

    export default function HomePage() {
      const sections = [
        <div
          key="s1"
          style={{
            background: 'lightblue',
            height: '100vh',
            display: 'flex',
            alignItems: 'center',
            justifyContent: 'center',
          }}
        >
          <h1>Welcome to Section One!</h1>
        </div>,
        <div
          key="s2"
          style={{
            background: 'lightcoral',
            height: '100vh',
            display: 'flex',
            alignItems: 'center',
            justifyContent: 'center',
          }}
        >
          <h2>Discover Section Two.</h2>
        </div>,
        <div
          key="s3"
          style={{
            background: 'lightgreen',
            height: '100vh',
            display: 'flex',
            alignItems: 'center',
            justifyContent: 'center',
          }}
        >
          <h3>Explore Section Three.</h3>
        </div>,
      ]

      return <StoryScroller sections={sections} />
    }
    ```

## Accessibility, Performance, and Test Caveats

Building a custom scroll system introduces significant trade-offs and risks that must be carefully managed.

### Accessibility Considerations

- **Scroll Hijacking Impact**: Custom scroll solutions inherently "hijack" native browser scroll behavior (`preventDefault: true`), which can severely impact accessibility.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Standard keyboard scrolling (arrow keys, spacebar, Page Up/Down) will be disabled. The component includes `tabIndex={0}` on sections to make them focusable, allowing keyboard users to navigate via the Tab key.
- **CSS Fallback**: `scroll-snap-type: proximity` is used as a safer CSS fallback to `mandatory`. If `mandatory` were used and content exceeded `100vh`, users could be trapped, unable to scroll. `proximity` allows snapping but doesn't prevent free scrolling.
- **Screen Reader Testing**: Continuous testing with screen readers (e.g., VoiceOver, NVDA) is crucial to verify content is announced in logical order and that `preventDefault` doesn't create unforeseen barriers.

### Performance Trade-offs

- **JavaScript Overhead**: JavaScript-driven scroll libraries, while enabling advanced effects, introduce overhead not present with native scrolling. This can lead to reduced frame rates and increased memory usage, especially on less powerful devices.
- **Memory Usage**: Combining Lenis, ScrollTrigger, and Observer can significantly increase memory footprint (e.g., +40-60MB with Observer, +60-100MB with pinning). Mobile Safari performance, in particular, can be poor (15-30fps).
- **Mobile Performance**: Smooth scroll libraries often tank mobile performance. Native scroll is 3-5x faster. This system acknowledges this trade-off, prioritizing the specific aesthetic.
- **Testing Performance**: Emulators and browser developer tools may not accurately reflect real device performance. **Always test on real, hostile hardware**.

### Testing Strategies

- **Focus on Outcomes**: Unit tests should assert the _result_ of an animation (e.g., element visibility, state change) rather than pixel-perfect intermediate animation states.
- **Mock Timing**: Globally force animations to finish immediately in test environments by setting GSAP tween durations to zero or mocking GSAP methods to instantly apply final states. Jest's fake timers can fast-forward `setTimeout` calls.
- **`prefers-reduced-motion`**: For E2E tests (e.g., Playwright), emulate the `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` media query. Implement global CSS or JS checks to cut animation durations to 0ms when this preference is active. This significantly speeds up E2E tests by avoiding waits for animations.
- **Cleanup Validation**: Ensure components properly clean up listeners and tweens on unmount. The `useGSAP` hook handles GSAP instances automatically, but other listeners (e.g., from Lenis, Observer) require manual cleanup.

## Living Danger List

This system, while robustly designed, is not infallible. A paranoid engineer remains vigilant to external threats and future changes that could compromise its stability.

- **Dependency Drift**: Future major versions of GSAP (e.g., 4.0), Lenis (e.g., 2.0), or `@gsap/react` could introduce breaking API changes. Pinning dependency versions provides short-term stability but accumulates technical debt. Constant vigilance on changelogs is required.
- **Next.js and React Evolution**: New React lifecycle behaviors (e.g., React 19 causing `useGSAP` contexts to revert animations unexpectedly) or changes in the Next.js App Router's server/client component model could introduce unexpected bugs.
- **OS and Browser Updates**: OS-level features like Mac trackpad momentum or browser implementations of `getBoundingClientRect` or event handling could change, invalidating current workarounds. Firefox/Logitech mouse throttling is a known example.
- **Layout Fragility and Upstream DOM Changes**: The `gotoSection` function relies on a predictable DOM structure. Refactoring that introduces new parent containers with transforms could break position calculations. Sticky headers/footers also require offsets. `ResizeObserver` or `window` resize events might be needed for dynamic layouts.
- **Third-Party Interference**: Other scripts or browser extensions (e.g., Grammarly, ColorZilla, LastPass, AdBlock) can interfere with scroll or DOM manipulation, leading to unpredictable results. Only one scroll-control mechanism should be active.
- **Accessibility Blind Spot**: Despite foundational accessibility features, scroll-jacking is inherently risky. Continuous testing with screen readers and keyboard-only users is an ongoing process.

# StoryScroller: Design Notes & Paranoid Engineering Commentary

This document serves as a "field manual" or an engineering diary, detailing the specific problems encountered during the development of this scroll system and the "paranoid" solutions devised to address them. Every major decision and workaround in `StoryScroller.tsx` is annotated here with its real-world problem, the source of the complaint (often forum threads or GitHub issues), and the rationale behind the chosen mitigation.

## 1. Core Component Selection (Revisited)

The selection of Lenis, GSAP, and `@gsap/react` was adversarial. Other alternatives like `locomotive-scroll v5` and `fullpage.js` were decisively rejected.

- **Locomotive Scroll v5**: Was a candidate due to being rebuilt on Lenis. However, it's definitively **not production-ready**. GitHub issues from 2024 showed critical bugs:

  - **Next.js Instability**: "jumps and bottom cutoff".
  - **SSR Failures**: `ReferenceError: window is not defined`. This signals a fragile architecture that doesn't safely handle server-side rendering.
  - **Architectural Flaws**: `_init()` method hardcodes `window` and `document.documentElement` for scroll wrapper, making custom container scrolling impossible.
  - **Widespread Bugs**: Broken mobile layouts, incorrect height calculations, conflicts, TypeScript errors.
  - _Conclusion_: An unacceptable level of risk for a production system.

- **fullpage.js**: Offered a turnkey solution but proved to be a "wrapper trap".
  - **Licensing**: GPLv3, making it legally problematic for most closed-source commercial projects without purchasing a commercial license.
  - **Integration Fragility**: Persistent issues in React wrapper: crashes on page reload, inability to scroll outside wrapper in Next.js, state conflicts preventing re-renders, `fullpage_api` not available.
  - _Conclusion_: A monolithic black box that prioritizes simplistic API over robust, composable architecture, antithetical to our design philosophy.

## 2. The Unholy Trinity of Production Failures & Workarounds

While the `README.md` outlines the issues, this section dives deeper into the "why" and "how" of their mitigation.

### 2.1. Next.js Hydration Mismatch (`setTimeout` Gambit / `suppressHydrationWarning` Surrender)

**The Problem**: GSAP's ScrollTrigger, upon initialization, often manipulates the `<body>` element's inline styles (e.g., `overflow` properties) to accurately calculate bounds for animations. When Next.js performs hydration, it compares the server-rendered HTML (which doesn't have these styles) with the client-side DOM (which does), leading to "Warning: Extra attributes from the server: style" or full hydration errors. This is a fundamental conflict between an imperative DOM-manipulating library and a declarative SSR framework.

**War Story**: Developers frequently resort to extreme measures, including disabling browser extensions (Grammarly, ColorZilla), using incognito mode, or resorting to `suppressHydrationWarning`. The Next.js team advises against suppressing warnings, while the GSAP team states these calculations are necessary.

**Workarounds Implemented in Code**:

- **Delayed Initialization (`setTimeout`)**: We delay the `ScrollTrigger.config()` and `ScrollTrigger.scrollerProxy()` setup by 100ms using `setTimeout`. This is a fragile hack relying on winning a race condition, hoping hydration completes before GSAP attempts its DOM modifications.
- **Post-Hydration Style Removal/Restore**: The `useEffect` block that checks for `document.body.getAttribute('style')` is a desperate measure. It attempts to remove ScrollTrigger's inline styles _before_ React's hydration check, then restores them _after_ hydration. This silences the warning but doesn't fix the underlying architectural conflict.

### 2.2. The Mac Trackpad's Unrelenting Momentum (Debouncing, `tolerance`, `overflow: hidden` Lock)

**The Problem**: Apple trackpads and Magic Mice continue to emit "wheel" events due to momentum _after_ the user has stopped physical interaction. If a snap animation completes faster than this residual momentum, another animation can be triggered, causing an infuriating "double-snap" or "triple-snap". There is **no perfect solution** for this; it's a hostile hardware reality.

**War Story**: GSAP forums are filled with reports of this "double fire" behavior. It's the most common hardware-related failure mode for Observer-based navigation.

**Workarounds Implemented in Code**:

- **`isAnimating` Flag**: A critical boolean ref (`isAnimating.current`) is set to `true` at the start of a `gotoSection` animation and `false` on `onComplete`. This creates a hard cooldown, effectively debouncing input and preventing new animations from firing while one is in progress.
- **`lastScrollTime` and `checkScrollEnd`**: A `setInterval` periodically checks if `Date.now() - lastScrollTime.current` exceeds a threshold (150ms). If so, it signifies the scroll momentum has likely ceased, and `isAnimating` is safely reset.
- **`Observer` `tolerance`**: The `tolerance` property on `Observer.create` is set to a high value (50). This dictates how much wheel/touch movement is required before an event fires. A higher value buffers against accidental micro-movements from momentum.
- **Firefox Throttling Workaround**: `onWheel` callback specifically targets Firefox with Logitech mice, boosting small delta movements to counteract throttling.

### 2.3. The Insidious Nature of Memory Leaks (Militant Cleanup, `contextSafe`, Pin Spacers)

**The Problem**: Even with React 18's Strict Mode and `useGSAP`, memory leaks are common if cleanup is not "militant". Orphaned event listeners, conflicting tickers, and detached DOM elements can accumulate, leading to performance degradation, "jank," and non-deterministic bugs.

**War Story**: Real production cases show `Tween` objects not being garbage collected, even after `null` assignment, leading to detached HTML elements. Community forums are littered with complaints about cumulative slowdowns due to forgotten cleanup.

**Workarounds Implemented in Code**:

- **`useGSAP` as Bastion**: Encapsulating all core logic in `useGSAP` ensures GSAP instances (tweens, ScrollTriggers created within its scope) are automatically reverted/cleaned up via `gsap.context()` on component unmount.
- **Explicit Non-GSAP Cleanup**: The `return` function of `useGSAP` is the "kill zone". We explicitly call `observer.kill()` and `lenisInstance.destroy()`. These objects attach global event listeners and manage internal state that `useGSAP` does _not_ automatically manage.
- **GSAP Ticker Removal**: The `gsap.ticker.remove(raf)` call is crucial. Forgetting this leads to multiple `requestAnimationFrame` loops running simultaneously, causing jank and CPU spikes.
- **`contextSafe()` for Callbacks**: Event listeners or animations created _inside_ GSAP callbacks (e.g., `onComplete`) can form closures that escape the `useGSAP` context, leading to leaks. Using `contextSafe()` (provided by `useGSAP`) wraps these functions, bringing them into the managed context.
- **`ScrollTrigger.killAll()` & `gsap.killTweensOf("*")`**: These are "nuclear options". `killAll()` is particularly useful for robust cleanup on route changes in Next.js, ensuring no stale ScrollTrigger instances remain. Killing all tweens globally is a paranoid last resort.
- **`pin-spacer` elements**: (Not directly addressed in `StoryScroller`'s core logic as it doesn't use pinning, but important context for `ScrollTrigger` users): ScrollTrigger's `pin: true` creates "pin-spacer" `<div>` elements. If ScrollTrigger instances are not properly killed, these spacers can be left in the DOM and held in memory, leading to leaks.

## 3. `getBoundingClientRect` vs. `offsetTop`

**The Problem**: Relying on `element.offsetTop` for calculating scroll targets. `offsetTop` is a relic that calculates position relative to an `offsetParent` and **does not account for modern CSS transforms** (e.g., `transform: translateY()`, `scale()`). This means if any parent element in the hierarchy has a transform, `offsetTop` will return an incorrect, pre-transform layout value, causing the scroll animation to land in the wrong place.

**War Story**: This is a common pitfall for developers building complex, dynamic layouts. Assuming no transforms exist in the parent tree is dangerously naive in modern component-based architectures.

**Workaround Implemented in Code**:

- `element.getBoundingClientRect().top + window.scrollY`. `getBoundingClientRect()` returns the element's position _as it is currently rendered in the viewport_, accounting for all CSS transforms and layouts. Adding `window.scrollY` converts this viewport-relative position to a document-relative one, which GSAP's `scrollTo` plugin expects.

## 4. CSS Fallbacks & `overscrollBehavior`

**The Problem**: A JavaScript-driven scroll experience should have a graceful fallback if JS fails or for users with `prefers-reduced-motion`. However, implementing CSS scroll-snap incorrectly (e.g., using `mandatory`) can lead to accessibility traps.

**Workarounds Implemented in Code**:

- **`scroll-snap-type: y proximity`**: Used on the main container. This is the **only safe, production-ready option**. It encourages snapping without "imprisoning" the user, allowing them to scroll past a section if its content overflows the viewport. Using `mandatory` would prevent users from seeing overflowing content.
- **`scroll-behavior: smooth`**: Provides a basic smooth scrolling experience as a fallback for browsers if Lenis fails or is not loaded.
- **`overscrollBehavior: 'none'`**: Applied to the container. This is a HACK to prevent the iOS "rubber-band" bounce effect that can interfere with custom scroll experiences.
- **Lenis Recommended CSS**: The `html.lenis`, `.lenis.lenis-smooth`, etc., classes are applied to ensure consistent behavior, especially for nested scroll areas and preventing layout shifts.

## 5. Next.js App Router Transitions

**The Problem**: With the Next.js App Router and client-side transitions, a fast page switch could unmount the `StoryScroller` component mid-scroll. A GSAP `scrollTo` tween might still be running when unmount happens, leading to orphaned animations or incorrect scroll positions on re-navigation.

**Workaround Implemented in Code**:

- **Route Change Listener (`popstate`)**: An `useEffect` listens for `popstate` events (which fire on browser back/forward navigation).
- **`window.scrollTo(0, 0)` and `ScrollTrigger.refresh(true)`**: On route change, the window is immediately scrolled to the top, and `ScrollTrigger` is forced to re-evaluate its positions. This is a "nuclear option" to reset scroll state and ensure consistency across page transitions.

This detailed log aims to provide future maintainers with the hard-won wisdom gained from building and debugging such a complex system. Staying vigilant and testing on real devices remain paramount.

# Glossary of Terms

- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: A powerful, high-performance JavaScript animation library used for creating complex, timeline-based animations and controlling DOM elements.
- **Lenis**: A lightweight, dependency-free JavaScript library designed to provide highly smooth and customizable scroll experiences, often used to override native browser scrolling.
- **Scroll-Jacking**: The practice of overriding the browser's default scroll behavior to implement custom scrolling effects, often for aesthetic or interactive purposes.
- **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**: A technique where web pages are rendered on the server before being sent to the client's browser, improving initial load performance and SEO.
- **Hydration**: The process in React (and other SPA frameworks) where the client-side JavaScript takes over a server-rendered HTML page, attaching event listeners and making it interactive.
- **StrictMode (React 18)**: A development mode in React that helps identify potential problems in an application by intentionally invoking effects and other lifecycle methods twice. This highlights issues with improper cleanup.
- **Debounce**: A programming practice used to limit the rate at which a function is called, ensuring it only fires after a certain period has passed without further activity (e.g., after GSAP animations into React components by automatically handling cleanup and scope management.
- **`gsap.context()`**: A feature within GSAP that creates a self-contained scope for animations and instances, allowing them to be easily reverted or cleaned up together.
- **`getBoundingClientRect()`**: A DOM method that returns the size of an element and its position relative to the viewport, accounting for all CSS transforms and layout changes.
- **`offsetTop`**: A DOM property that returns the top position of an element relative to its `offsetParent`. It does not account for CSS transforms and can provide inaccurate results in modern layouts.
- **`tolerance` (GSAP Observer)**: A setting in the GSAP Observer plugin that defines how much movement (e.g., wheel delta) is required before an event is considered significant enough to trigger a callback. Used to filter out small, accidental movements.
- **`preventDefault: true`**: A property in event handlers or configurations that stops the browser's default action for a given event (e.g., stops native scrolling for a wheel event).
```
